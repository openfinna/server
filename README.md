# openfinna API server
OpenFinna Server is a project aimed to offer open APIs to Kirkes and Finna for everyone who wants it (that includes libraries in Tuusula, Järvenpää, Kerava, Mäntsälä and 20+ more). For that this backend is providing "proxy", which makes it easy to use Finna's basic functionality as a REST API

## Why is this existing in the first place?
All libraries refused to give me API access, I was very disappointed, I even tried to be nice to them, waited two months to get an answer. I was empty handed at that point, and started thinking about other ways. Only solution was to make this API that doesn't rely on their Library System.

## How does it work?
By parsing HTML, and some JSON (AJAX calls)
